# canto

Composable, minimal-abstraction Go framework for building LLM agents and agent swarms.
Designed for optimal developer experience, production reliability, and SOTA research ideas.

## Project Structure

| Directory  | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `llm/`     | Layer 1: Provider-agnostic LLM interface, streaming, cost            |
| `agent/`   | Layer 2: Agent loop (perceive → decide → act → observe)              |
| `session/` | Layer 3a: Durable append-only event log, JSONL/SQLite stores         |
| `context/` | Layer 3b: Context engineering pipeline, compaction, KV-cache helpers |
| `tool/`    | Layer 3c: Tool execution, registry, MCP client/server                |
| `skill/`   | Layer 3d: Progressive disclosure skill packages (SKILL.md standard)  |
| `runtime/` | Layer 3e: Session execution, lane queue, heartbeat, workspace config |
| `memory/`  | Layer 3f: In-context + external memory, SQLite-backed, vector store  |
| `x/`       | Extension packages: graph, swarm, eval, channel, rl, obs, guardrail  |
| `ai/`      | Local-only AI session context — excluded via `.git/info/exclude`     |
| `.tasks/`  | Local-only task tracker state — excluded via `.git/info/exclude`     |

### AI Context Organization

**Purpose:** Keep project state between sessions without polluting public git history.

**Session files** (local only, read every session):

- `ai/STATUS.md` — current state, blockers, active work (read FIRST)
- `ai/DESIGN.md` — architecture, layer breakdown, interface decisions
- `ai/DECISIONS.md` — append-only design decisions with rationale
- `ai/ROADMAP.md` — 4-phase implementation plan and phase gates

**Reference files** (local only, loaded on demand):

- `ai/research/` — external research, prior art notes
- `ai/design/` — per-package deep specs
- `ai/tmp/` — scratch artifacts (gitignored)

**Task tracking:** `tk` CLI with `.tasks/` kept local-only. Use `tk ready` to find pending work.

## Commands

```bash
# Format (only tracked files)
make fmt

# Test
make test

# Build
make build

# Format + test + build
make check

# Tidy
go mod tidy
```

## Verification Steps

Commands that must pass before shipping:

- Build: `make build`
- Tests: `make test`
- Format: `make fmt`

## Code Standards

| Aspect         | Standard                                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture   | Layers depend downward only; extensions depend on Layer 3, never reverse                     |
| State          | Session event log is append-only — never mutate or delete events                             |
| Interfaces     | Keep the 5 core interfaces small; compose from them                                          |
| Context        | `ContextProcessor` is a pure function — no side effects on session                           |
| Orchestration  | Graph routing and coordination are Go functions; agent behavior within a turn is LLM-decided |
| Compaction     | Offload (reversible) before summarize (lossy); never skip to summarize                       |
| Tool loading   | Lazy when > 20 tools; present `search_tools` meta-tool first                                 |
| KV cache       | System prompt always first message; never reorder or modify message prefix                   |
| Error handling | Let errors propagate; catch only to recover                                                  |
| Naming         | Proportional to scope; no V2/legacy/new markers                                              |

## Go Idioms

Use the `go-expert` skill for full guidance. Key modern idioms:

- `slices` / `maps` packages — not manual loops or `sort.Slice`
- `iter.Seq` / `iter.Seq2` — range-over-function iterators (Go 1.23+)
- `sync.WaitGroup.Go` — replaces `Add(1); go func() { defer Done() }()`
- `errors.AsType[T](err)` — type-safe error unwrapping (Go 1.26)
- `t.Context()` in tests — not `context.TODO()`

## Design Principles

1. **Explicit coordination** — graph routing and task assignment are Go code; agents decide their own behavior within a turn
2. **Composable over complete** — small well-designed interfaces that compose cleanly
3. **Append-only state** — session event log is never mutated, ever

## Development Workflow

1. Research prior art → `ai/research/{topic}.md`
2. Synthesize architecture → `ai/DESIGN.md` or `ai/design/{package}.md`
3. Record decision → `ai/DECISIONS.md`
4. Check phase gate → `ai/ROADMAP.md`
5. Implement with TDD — test gates in spec must pass before moving phases
6. Run `go test ./... && go build ./...`
7. Update `ai/STATUS.md` with findings

## Current Focus

See local `ai/STATUS.md` for active work and `ai/ROADMAP.md` for phase status.
